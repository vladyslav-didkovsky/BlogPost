Project Motivation

Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the COVID19 datasets were collected and investigated. Five bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

  2. What is the impact of quarantine policy to the spreading of COVID-19 for each country?
  3. What is the relationship between number of test to confirmed cases?
  4. Which aspect of the country correlate most with COVID-19 cases and deaths?
  5. What is the relationship between healthcare system of the country and COVID-19 cases and deaths?
